start while loop for the program to run
create a blank board -- empty list with empty spaces " "
prompt user to choose "X" or "O", based on their choice assign a letter for the computer
determine who goes first by random coin flip
within while loop start a while game loop so when game ends, user can restart
draw the board
get the player's move
check if that move is going to result in a win 
the isWinner function will accept a board argument and the letter to check for
isWinner will have all permutations resulting in a win
check if that move will result in a full board aka tie  with isBoardFull
else, make the move and then make it the computers turn

if it is the computer's move, 
we need to have the computer choose a move, 
that will block the player from success, or will result in a computer win.
When the board is blank or player has no chance of winning yet,
have the computer preference a corner spot and then middle

to check if the move would result in a win,
we should make a copy of the board to not affect the original data
go through each spot, make a move there, 
check if on of the conditions is true 
(player would win here so block, computer would win here so win)
